This is a FAKE business website. Made 99% by vibe code.

Made by John Wendt, Tymofii Khilobok, Geran Nelson, Chance Ladd, and Spencer Reitz
for
CSE 290R (Special Topics - AI Essentials)

We planned up the business within our shared pdf document. All material on there is prompted and only slightly touched up manually.
The website is vibe coded, and the only manual change was the favicon, to implement the site logo.
